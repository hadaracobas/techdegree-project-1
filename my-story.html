        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p>Five years ago, my work was not connected to the internet in any way. I actually worked in a kiosk near my house.
At that time, I was debating what to do next; maybe going on a trip? Enrolling in University?
While working at the kiosk, however, an idea came to my mind which I couldn't get out of my head.
Selling the same products that I sell to people who come to the kiosk also to people at home. But what is the most efficient way to sell? Of course .. on the Internet. I decided to give it a try and go for it.
I signed up to one of the site development platforms with a simple interface and did not need much prior knowledge to start building my first online store. I soon finished building an impressive store given the knowledge I had at that time which allowed me to sell small products online. I was very pleased with the result and also most delighted by the fact that I built a website alone.</p>

        <p>I really fell in love with the world of the Internet in general and building websites in particular.
At this point, I decided to take a few short courses to expand my knowledge and soon after started offering my services to the general public as a website builder.
So I took on a few projcets but soon realized that I was in trouble. It's not that the sites I built were not good, they were not good enough. They could not answer every problem. I was actually limited in my abilities to offer satisfying solutions to the needs of my clients and their respective businesses. I realized that in order to give my customers the highest quality websites with endless functionality and design options, I had to jump in at the deep end and start working with WordPress !!!
I took a few courses  and started using the platform to build websites for customers.

       <p>I think WordPress is a great system that gives you the ability to build great websites with good visual functionality. But Can I find a job as a developer with my present knowlege of WordPress? Definitely not!
This is what led me to the next decision ... to go for the real thing ... to learn to code! Learn the code and get to the heart of programming so that I can work as a professional web developer and give real value to my work.
This is where my way into the programming world begins as a profession of life, and Treehouse brought me this option. Thank you very much for this opportunity!</p>
